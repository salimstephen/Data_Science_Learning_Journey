#  My Data Science Learning Journey

Welcome to my data science learning journey!  
I started as a complete beginner, working with data in **Excel**, and gradually expanded my skills into **SQL**, **Python**, and **data visualization**.  

This repository documents my hands-on learning — from foundational exercises to real-world projects — as I build the technical and analytical skills needed to become a **data-driven problem solver**.

###  What You'll Find Here
- **SQL Practice Notebooks** — exploring data, filtering, and analysis using MySQL  
- **Data Cleaning & Exploration Projects** — working with real-world datasets  
- **Python for Data Analysis** — learning Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib  
- **Visualization & Insights** — turning data into clear, meaningful stories  

###  My Goal
To become a **data scientist** capable of using technology and analytics to solve real-world problems — especially in Africa and globally.
