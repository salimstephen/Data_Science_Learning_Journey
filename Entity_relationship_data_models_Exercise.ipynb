    "# Entity-Relationship Data Models (Northwind Database)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this exercise, we will learn to:\n",
    "- Identify the primary key(s) for each table in an ERD.\n",
    "- Differentiate between entities and relationships.\n",
    "- Understand the concept of **cardinality**.\n",
    "- Identify and interpret **foreign keys** and **associative entities**.\n",
    "- Modify an ERD to include new entities or attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The **Northwind Database** models a trading company’s operations, including customers, employees, products, suppliers, orders, and related details.  \n",
    "The ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) visually represents how these tables are connected and how data flows between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Exercise 1\n",
    "### Identify and list the primary key(s) for each table in the ERD.  \n",
    "Why do you think these specific columns were chosen as the primary keys?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Table | Primary Key | Reason |\n",
    "|--------|--------------|--------|\n",
    "| Customers | `CustomerID` | Each customer has a unique identifier. |\n",
    "| Employees | `EmployeeID` | Distinguishes each employee uniquely. |\n",
    "| Orders | `OrderID` | Uniquely identifies each order placed. |\n",
    "| OrderDetails | Composite Key: (`OrderID`, `ProductID`) | Each order can contain multiple products, so both fields together ensure uniqueness. |\n",
    "| Products | `ProductID` | Uniquely identifies each product. |\n",
    "| Suppliers | `SupplierID` | Each supplier is distinct and identified by this key. |\n",
    "| Categories | `CategoryID` | Used to categorize products. |\n",
    "| Shippers | `ShipperID` | Identifies each shipping company uniquely. |\n",
    "| Territories | `TerritoryID` | Uniquely identifies each sales territory. |\n",
    "| Region | `RegionID` | Represents unique geographic regions. |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why chosen:**  \n",
    "These columns serve as **unique identifiers** — they prevent duplicate records and allow precise relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Exercise 2\n",
    "### In the ERD, which tables represent entities, and which represent relationships?  \n",
    "Justify your categorisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Entities (real-world objects):**\n",
    "  - Customers, Employees, Products, Suppliers, Categories, Shippers, Territories, Region.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relationship Tables (linking or associative entities):**\n",
    "  - Orders (links Customers and Employees),\n",
    "  - OrderDetails (links Orders and Products),\n",
    "  - EmployeeTerritories (links Employees and Territories).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:**  \n",
    "Entity tables store core business data, while relationship tables capture interactions **between** entities (e.g., an order connecting a customer and an employee).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Exercise 3\n",
    "### Discuss the concept of cardinality by explaining the relationship between the `Customers` and `Orders` tables.  \n",
    "Why is this type of cardinality appropriate?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cardinality:** One-to-Many (1:N)  \n",
    "  - One **Customer** can place **many Orders**.\n",
    "  - Each **Order** belongs to exactly **one Customer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why appropriate:**  \n",
    "This matches real-world business logic — a single customer may place multiple orders over time, but each order originates from one customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Exercise 4\n",
    "### Analyse the relationship between the `Orders` and `OrderDetails` tables.  \n",
    "What does this relationship represent? Identify the foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relationship:** One-to-Many (1:N)\n",
    "  - One **Order** can contain **many OrderDetails** (line items).\n",
    "  - Each **OrderDetail** belongs to one **Order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Foreign Keys:**\n",
    "  - In `OrderDetails`:  \n",
    "    - `OrderID` → references `Orders(OrderID)`  \n",
    "    - `ProductID` → references `Products(ProductID)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Meaning:**  \n",
    "This relationship represents an **order transaction** containing several **products**, with each line specifying quantity, unit price, and discounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Exercise 5\n",
    "### Identify any associative entities in the Northwind database.  \n",
    "Explain why these are considered associative entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Associative Entities:**\n",
    "  - `OrderDetails`: connects `Orders` and `Products`.\n",
    "  - `EmployeeTerritories`: connects `Employees` and `Territories`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:**  \n",
    "These tables exist **solely to manage many-to-many relationships**:\n",
    "- Many orders can include many products.\n",
    "- Many employees can manage multiple territories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Exercise 6\n",
    "### Add a new attribute to the `Products` entity that tracks the date the product was last ordered.  \n",
    "How would this update the ERD?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a new attribute: `LastOrderDate` (Data Type: DATE)\n",
    "- The `Products` table now includes:\n",
    "  - `ProductID`, `ProductName`, `SupplierID`, `CategoryID`, `QuantityPerUnit`, `UnitPrice`, `UnitsInStock`, `LastOrderDate`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:**\n",
    "- Minimal impact on relationships — no foreign keys change.\n",
    "- Useful for tracking sales recency and restocking cycles.\n",
    "- The ERD now shows an additional attribute under the `Products` entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Exercise 7\n",
    "### Introduce a new feature for \"Discount Coupons\".\n",
    "Each coupon can be used multiple times, but has a maximum total use.  \n",
    "A customer can use multiple coupons for a single order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**New Entities and Relationships:**\n",
    "1. **Coupons**\n",
    "   - `CouponID` (Primary Key)\n",
    "   - `CouponCode`\n",
    "   - `DiscountValue`\n",
    "   - `MaxUsageCount`\n",
    "   - `ExpirationDate`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **OrderCoupons** (Associative Entity)\n",
    "   - Composite Key: (`OrderID`, `CouponID`)\n",
    "   - `UsageCount`\n",
    "   - Foreign Keys:\n",
    "     - `OrderID` → `Orders(OrderID)`\n",
    "     - `CouponID` → `Coupons(CouponID)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cardinalities:**\n",
    "- One **Coupon** → used in **many Orders** (1:N)\n",
    "- One **Order** → can have **many Coupons** (N:M via `OrderCoupons`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Updated ERD Summary:**\n",
    "- New entity `Coupons`\n",
    "- New relationship table `OrderCoupons`\n",
    "- Many-to-many link between `Orders` and `Coupons`\n"
